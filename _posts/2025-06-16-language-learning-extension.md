# How a Browser-Based AI Assistant Supercharged My Language Learning

🌍 I’ve always wanted to become fluent in Japanese and Korean. Like many others, I tried the usual routes: Duolingo, grammar books, YouTube videos. But what truly changed the game for me was integrating an AI assistant—**right inside my browser**.

It started out simple: I was reading a Japanese tech blog and kept pausing every two lines to paste unknown words into Google Translate. It was frustrating and disruptive. Then I discovered a browser extension that let me **highlight any text and instantly ask an AI assistant**—right there, on the same page.

No more tab-switching. No more distractions.

### 🧠 A Language Tutor on Every Website

With the extension installed, I could:

- 🔍 **Highlight a phrase** and ask for translation, context, or even a simpler version.
- 📘 **Learn vocabulary in real sentences**, instead of out-of-context flashcards.
- 📝 **Ask grammar questions on the fly**, like “Why is this verb in plain form?”
- 🌐 **Practice reading websites in multiple languages**, using the AI as support.

I started reading Japanese news sites, Korean product reviews, and even manga—and every time I got stuck, I just asked the AI. The responses were surprisingly helpful: **natural, concise, and tailored to the sentence I was looking at.**

### 🎯 How It Changed My Learning Routine

Before using the AI assistant:

- I struggled to read native content without losing momentum.
- I avoided long articles because I knew they’d take too long to decode.
- I often felt frustrated and mentally drained from constant switching.

After using it for just a few weeks:

- 🚀 I read faster and retained more.
- 🧩 I learned grammar patterns in real context—not in isolation.
- 🎧 I even started combining it with YouTube subtitles to ask questions mid-video!

It felt like I had a **patient, 24/7 language tutor** beside me—one that never got tired of my questions.
