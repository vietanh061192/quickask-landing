# 🤖 A Tiny AI Tip With Big Impact — You Might Already Know It

When I was a kid, I loved watching those classic Hong Kong gangster movies.  
You know the ones—where the boss just raises an eyebrow, nods slightly, or lifts a finger... and the crew jumps into action, no questions asked.

No yelling. No over-explaining. Just cool, silent control.

🥲 Now that I’m older, I’ve realized:  
That kind of smooth command?  
It takes **patience**, and the mindset of a **true coach**.

## 🎯 So… How Do You Make AI *That* Obedient?

How do you get ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc. to understand your intentions with just a glance—or, in our case, a short prompt?

The answer:  
👉 **Create your own command language.**  
Think *aliases*, *shortcuts*, *personal codes*.

### Example?

Instead of typing this whole thing every time:

> “Translate the following sentence into Arabic in a natural, polite, easy-to-understand tone: Oh I see.”

I just define a rule:

- `>` = “translate into the last requested language, natural & polite tone”  
- `<` = “translate back to Vietnamese”

Now I type:

> Oh I see

🎯 One keystroke. One result. Super clean.

## 🧠 Prompts Shouldn’t Be a Workout

Typing a 3-line instruction every time you need help? Exhausting.  
Sometimes just breathing is hard enough, let alone retyping boilerplate prompts.

Trust me.  
Or at least... trust your raised eyebrow. 😎
