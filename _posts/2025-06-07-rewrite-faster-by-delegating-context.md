# 🧠 Rewrite Faster by Delegating Context — AI Isn’t a Mind Reader

Ever ask AI to “make it better” and get… something worse?

That’s because you skipped the context.  
AI doesn’t know your audience. Your tone. Or that you're angry but want to sound polite.

---

## ✅ Try This Instead:

> "I'm writing to a coworker who always delays things. I'm frustrated but want to sound calm. Rewrite this sentence to be firm, not rude."

👆 That one line of setup = 10x better output. Every time.

---

## 🔄 Don’t Just Say "Rewrite This"

Say:
- Who you’re talking to  
- What you want to convey  
- What emotion to keep or hide  
- What tone you’re aiming for

---

## ✨ It’s Not Prompting. It’s Delegating.

You're briefing your assistant, not coding a command.

And the best part?  
With **QuickAsk AI**, you can just highlight text, right-click, and give your instruction directly.  
No tabs. No back and forth.
